            We would like to tell about our restaurant. It is called Home Food. We
            located in the city centre. The restaurant serves traditional Italian
            cuisine in a calma and relaxing atmosphere. In front of the entrance
            there is a summer terrace where guests can enjoy a light business
            lunch or a cup of coffee. The interior of the restaurant is elegantly
            decorated in warm colours. Quiet music is played in the background.
            Guests can order fresh pizza, delicious pasta as well as excellent
            meat and fish specialties. A wide range of salads and snacks is also
            served here. After a lunch or dinner, you will be offered to try one
            of the desserts. The meal can be accompanied by alcoholic and
            non-alcoholic cocktails. Prices in this restaurant are affordable.
            Waiters are very attentive and can assist with the choice of the
            dishes. I have their loyalty card and receive 5% discount every time I
            go there. You can also order food online and they will deliver it to
            your door. The delivery is free of charge.
